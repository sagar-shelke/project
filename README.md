Run the code as:
        Go to project repository
      type   "make"  and enter
       ./project
    .    
This simple text editor is implemented using "C" language and "ncurses" library .

Also I updated a help tab please see to it before start typing it shows different keyboard shortcuts.

It also does the following functions:

1. Create a file 

2. Delete entire line 

3. Save a file.

4. And finally a Help Tab which shows keyboard shortcuts for functions.
